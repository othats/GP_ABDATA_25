### About this Repository

This repository was developed in the context of the Aigües de Barcelona (AB) Data Challenge, adapted for our Project Management course.
Our team was not formally selected for the challenge; instead, we use the challenge’s theme and structure as a case study to apply project management principles and practice data analysis workflows.

All data used here are synthetic or publicly available sample datasets designed to mimic the format and complexity of the official challenge data.
The purpose is to demonstrate project planning, data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and visualization, not to produce competition-grade predictive results.

> Disclaimer: This project is an academic exercise based on sample data and is not an official submission to the Aigües de Barcelona Data Challenge.

### Objectives

- Explore water consumption patterns across districts, uses, and time in the city of Barcelona.
- Apply project management methodologies (WBS, risk analysis, progress tracking) to structure the data project.
- Demonstrate an analytical workflow from data collection to visualization and interpretation.
